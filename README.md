Files for running bayesian inference

4 different bayseian inference files for fitting different cosmologocal parameter. Every files to be run with 'constants', 'constants_gw', 'jgwpop', and 'jgwcosmo_wDM' or 'jgwcosmo'

I.e. For fitting w_DM, run 'Jose_toy_model_perfect_measurements_wDM' with 'jgwcosmo_wDM' .  
For running w_DE, change one line in  'jgwcosmo_wDM' (use line 9 and comment out line 10)

Result for Jose_toy_model_perfect_measurements_Omk doesnt work
